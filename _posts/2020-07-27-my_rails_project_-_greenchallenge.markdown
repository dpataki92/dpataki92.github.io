As my Rails portfolio project, I built a basic social network platform for people who intend to pursue an eco-friendly lifestyle.

In this application, users can commit to built-in challenges that represent green habits (e.g. Shorten Your Shower Time, Have A Vegetarian Day, etc.) or even create new challenges and share them with other users. Users can set the regularity of their commitments (e.g. daily or occasional) and generate daily to-do lists with their timely challenges. They can mark the challenges complete, submit their to-do lists, and collect points for the completed challenges. Users can set average point goals and ask for reports containing the results of a certain period.

In addition, users can join or create groups. Groups are organized around a cross-cutting issue (e.g. Sustainable water consumption) or a geographical location (e.g. Olympia, WA). Groups have recommended challenges that user can commit to at once and forums where members can share posts with each other. Users also get points for the likes they get from other group members for their posts.

The project walkthrough video is available via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bJH70e7IpVLHxK1L7CkyrQauVtG72PM4/view?usp=sharing) and if you would like to try out the application in your browser or contribute to the code, you can find the repository here on [GitHub](https://github.com/dpataki92/GreenChallenge/).
