As my React/Redux portfolio project, I built an improved version of my previous Sinatra application. Lawtalk is a legal Q&A site that intends to function as a “legal stack overflow” where users can discuss legal issues, ask questions, provide answers, upvote or downvote answers and search for Q&A threads relevant to their jurisdiction and chosen legal areas in various ways. 

My typical users include legal professionals who want to discuss interesting legal problems with their colleagues, research for input to use during their own work, or provide support to other users by answering legal questions. In addition, users might be people without a legal background who try to find help in certain legal problems they faced. 

The project walkthrough video is available via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F9GvK9J4l0MUg9eQhwqkdAEe-MDoDPSr/view?usp=sharing) and if you would like to try out the application in your browser or contribute to the code, you can find the repository here on [GitHub](https://github.com/dpataki92/lawtalk).
